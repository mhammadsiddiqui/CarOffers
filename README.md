## `Minimal Path to Awesome`

- Clone this repository
- Ensure that you are at the solution folder (i.e. cd Sixt.CarOffers)
- in the command-line run:
  - **npm install**
  - **npm start**

### `Why ?`

-`Axios`
  This package is used to make promise-based request. Although I got CORS errors on trying to fetch data. So I saved the data as a json file ‘carOffers.json’. 
  But I left the implementation as it is to show how I intended to get data.
-`sweetalert2`
  This package is used to show alert box in case of error on fetching data. So, user knows if network request was failed.
-`Bootstrap, reactstrap`
  This packages are used for styling of navigation tabs and layout.

### `npm start`
